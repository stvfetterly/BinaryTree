BinaryTreeApp:

This is a templated binary search tree implementation in C++, created in visual studio 2010.


TestHarness.cpp is a console program that quickly runs through the functions of the binary tree (creation, insertion, deletion, finding biggest/smallest value).  Actual implementation of the tree occurs in BinaryTree.h and Node.h.
